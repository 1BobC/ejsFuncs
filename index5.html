    <h1>Passing round function values</h1>
<div class= comparison>
    <p>
        <strong>Comparison - A large program is a costly program</strong>, and not just because of the time it takes to build. 
        Size almost always involves complexity, and complexity confuses programmers. 
        Confused programmers, in turn, introduce mistakes (bugs) into programs. 
        A large program then provides a lot of space for these bugs to hide, making them hard to find.

    <p>Higher order functions -  allow us to abstract over actions, not just values.</p>
    <p> - and allow functions that change other functions.</p>
