    <div class= returnNote>
    <p><strong>Important(to me!)</strong> A return statement determines the value the function returns. 
        When control comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function 
        and gives the returned value to the code that called the function. 
        A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return undefined. 
        Functions that don’t have a return statement at all, such as makeNoise, similarly return 
        undefined.</p>
    </div>
    <div class= passValue>
    <p><strong>A function value</strong> can do all the things that other values can do—you can use it in 
        arbitrary expressions, not just call it. It is possible to store a function value 
        in a new binding, pass it as an argument to a function, and so on.</p>
    <p><strong> In Chapter 5, we will discuss the interesting things that can be done by passing around 
        function values to other functions. So go there now!</strong></p>
